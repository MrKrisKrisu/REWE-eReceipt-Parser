[![Codacy Badge](https://app.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/6bbb1a99e88f4df198db20314bb42bf5)](https://www.codacy.com/gh/MrKrisKrisu/REWE-eReceipt-Parser/dashboard?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=MrKrisKrisu/REWE-eReceipt-Parser&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

## Installation

```
$ composer require mrkriskrisu/rewe-ereceipt-parser
```

## Example Usage

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use K118\Receipt\REWE\Parser;

$receipt = Parser::parseFromPDF('receipt.pdf');

echo "You've paid " . $receipt->getTotalPrice() . " Euros.";
```

## Requirements

If you want to use the build in PDF Parser you need to install ``pdftotext`` in your system. But don't worry, you can
use your own PDF to Text Software if you want and give it to the eReceipt-Parser via
the ``Parser::parseFromText($text)`` function.

## Get the eReceipt

To get your digital Receipt at REWE you need to register at rewe.de and connect your bonus card (PAYBACK) to the
account. Then you can activate the "eBon" in the settings and you'll receive the receipt after every purchase via Mail.
